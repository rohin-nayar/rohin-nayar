# Hello, I'm Rohin!  

## Bio

Graduate of **Imperial College London (MEng Aerospace Engineering)** and former Software Engineer in the Advanced Concepts and Robotics department at **Airbus Defence and Space**.

My work centres on building high-performance systems at the intersection of machine learning, control, and scalable computation, with experience spanning robotics, distributed data systems, and GPU-accelerated simulation.

- Design for scalability from the outset  
- Separate domain logic from parallel implementation  
- Prefer clarity over premature abstraction  
- Make performance explicit and reproducible
